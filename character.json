Barton is depicted as an expert marksman, archer and hand-to-hand combatant, with his preferred weapon being a recurve bow. Barton becomes an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. and befriends Natasha Romanoff. Later, Barton is recruited by Steve Rogers and becomes a founding member of the Avengers. He aids the team in the Battle of New York, the HYDRA uprising, and the Ultron Offensive, in which he forms a close bond with Wanda Maximoff. Barton then aids Rogers in his effort to protect Bucky Barnes, alongside Sam Wilson, Maximoff, and Scott Lang. After Barton's family is decimated by The Blip, he becomes a vigilante and violently dismantles organized crime as Ronin. However, Romanoff finds him and brings him back to the team, where they quantum time travel to alternate timelines in order to undo the Blip. After they are successful, Barton participates in the Battle at the Avengers Compound.[a][4] Barton then returns to his family. On a family vacation, his time as Ronin causes continued conflicts with various elements of organized crime and he takes in a protégé named Kate Bishop."
